# Regular Expression
A regular expression is a pattern that can be used to match, search, or replace strings. 
They are often used to validate input, search for patterns, and perform other tasks related to manipulating text.

In JavaScript, you can use regular expressions by creating a RegExp object. Here's an example of how to create a regular expression that matches a string that starts with "hello" and ends with "world":
```JavaScript
const regex = new RegExp('^hello.*world$');
```
